Each class or Work Out of the Day (WOD) is different and is taught by an experienced and certified instructor. Designed with functional movement in mind, CrossFit will make you stronger, faster, and most importantly: Fit.</span></p><p><span>"The needs of the Olympic athlete and our grandparents differ by degree not kind." We scale the program so that elite athletes and grandmothers can do a variation of the same workout side-by-side and both get a great stimulus. Weights, movements, and reps can all be modified in order to accomplish this. &nbsp;All we need from you is commitment.</span></p></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseTwo" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What makes your gym different from others in the area? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><p>When you step into our facility, you will see the Infiltrate difference. We have lots of beautiful outdoor space. Pull the rowers out to face the canal as you burn through a WOD. Our equipment is of the highest quality and our space is brand new. It was built with CrossFit in mind. We will start with two rooms allowing us to run simultaneous classes such as CrossFit Kids, On Ramp and Express classes so there are more options for you to tailor your CrossFit experience to you.&nbsp;</p><p>The owner is an experienced CrossFit coach and athlete. He has logged thousands of coaching hours and has helped people of all skill levels safely reach their goals, while himself has competed at the highest level in the sport: The CrossFit Games.</p><p>Ultimately it is our care and commitment to you that will separate us. We will listen to your input, and always put the client first.</p></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseThree" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> How much focus will I get from a coach in your gym? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><p>We limit class sizes so that you can get the attention you need. During our Intro and On Ramp classes, we are dedicating a lot of individual focus to laying your foundation. We will get to know how you move and be able to help you out as you develop with us.</p><p>Even in the group classes, you can expect specific instruction and coaching. We will always have an eye to make sure everyone is staying safe while at the same time motivating you to push yourself beyond what you thought was possible.</p></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseFour" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> Is CrossFit safe? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><p>We can all agree that carelessness is not safe. Now, I should also say that with any physical activity, there&rsquo;s going to be aches and pains along the way. A car that never gets used never needs to go to the mechanic. So, as you begin to become active you may experience some discomfort in the shoulder for example. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that CrossFit caused it, but probably means that the disfunction that was already there is becoming visible because you&rsquo;re starting to use it in CrossFit.</p><p>The list below is the quick track to injury and pain.</p><ul><li>Prioritizing personal records over proper form.</li><li>Being dishonest about limitations.</li><li>Neglecting recovery: active rest, mobilizing, and proper nutrition.</li></ul><p>We will help you as much as we can with these things, but there is also a good deal of responsibility on the individual to maintain their health and safety.</p><p>We will spend sufficient time and energy warming up, strengthening, and securing the joints in our classes.</p></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseFive" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> Is CrossFit Easy? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body">No.</div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseSix" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What are the different classes? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><strong>Free Intro Class:</strong> This class happens every Thursday at 6pm. It is free but you still need to create a login on our website. Then, reserve a spot on the schedule on the &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; tab. This class is one hour and is designed as an opportunity to familiarize yourself with our facility, our coaches and community, and CrossFit.</li><li><strong>EXPRESS Class:</strong> EXPRESS Classes are designed to be a bit shorter (45 minutes) and focus on cardio vascular health. We use CrossFit methodology and functional movements in order to get you in shape. We do not use some of the more technical and complicated movements like handstand push ups or muscle ups, and we don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time developing strength with barbell movements. We do use a lot of interval training, bodyweight exercise, medicine balls, kettlebell work, rowing, and run/walking. This is not to say you won&rsquo;t get stronger in these classes, but for those not interested in heavy barbell training, this is probably the class for you. Pricing is lower than Regular Classes.</li><li><strong>On Ramp Course:</strong> The On Ramp course takes place over three classes, and can be completed in one week. It is broken down into Class A (offered each Monday at 7am and 7pm), Class B (offered each Tuesday at 7am and 7 pm), and Class C (offered each Friday at 7am or 4pm). You do not need to take them in order, but you do need to take each unique class.</li><ul><li>We will go over the 9 basic CrossFit movements along with a few others.</li><li>This is a time for you to get even more individual attention as we as coaches, and you as an athlete, assess your abilities.</li><li>It&rsquo;s a way for the body to begin acclimation to new movements and relatively intense exercise.</li><li>Do NOT expect to master these movements in this time. Mastering many of these movements will take weeks, months, and sometimes years.</li><li>DO expect to get the basic knowledge to move forward with more confidence knowing that you can safely ramp up your intensity and accomplish your goals.</li></ul><li><strong>Regular Classes:</strong> Regular Classes, Group Class (typical CrossFit Class,) and Open Gym classes. On Ramp or extensive CrossFit experience is required for these classes. Even in Regular classes, we will scale movements and weights according to individual need and will always put safety first.</li><li><strong>Crossfit Kids:</strong> <a href="http://crossfitkids.com/about-us/">See their website.</a> This is a great way to build a cohesive family. Why not bring you kids, have them do a workout while you yourself get one in?</li><ul></ul></ul></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseSeven" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> How Do I Join? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><p>Hey! Thanks for checking us out. The process is simple.</p><ol><li>First, look around. Check out the website and and Facebook page. If you like what you see, and you&rsquo;re not interested in taking the easy way out to an improved self, then proceed to step two.</li><li>Figure out what track you need to start.</li><ul><li>If you&rsquo;ve never done CrossFit, and you just want a no-obligations introduction to check out our facility, coaches, and CrossFit in general, you&rsquo;ll want to start with our free intro class. You&rsquo;ll need to reserve your spot in the intro class (see directions below).</li><ul><li>You will learn about us, and we will learn about you. CrossFit is universally scalable (meaning that each movement can be modified so that it is accessible to everyone, and I mean everyone), but in order for the coaches to know your specific needs, we need to have some time accessing your abilities and limitations in order to keep you safe and in order to best help you reach your goals.</li><li>At this point, it is up to you to decide if you would like to go on from here.</li></ul><li>If you have a little bit of CrossFit experience (less than 3 months of consistent CrossFit instruction) then you can start with the intro if you like, or you can jump straight to signing up for a 3-class On Ramp Course.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re not interested in doing some of the more advanced and technical movements, and you&rsquo;d rather not do barbell strength training, the EXPRESS option is likely for you. This requires no On Ramp, and is similar but different in structure and pricing than Regular classes.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re experienced in CrossFit, <a href="mailto:jared@crossfitinfiltrate.com">email Jared</a> to let him know that you&rsquo;ll be jumping into Regular Classes.</li><li>Of course, if you need help in deciding where to start, <a href="mailto:jared@crossfitinfiltrate.com">email Jared</a> and he&rsquo;d be glad to help.</li><li>For more information about class options click see <a class="collapsed" href="#collapseSix" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion">What are the Different Classes?</a></li></ul><li>Once you know what class you want to start with, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ASP/home.asp?studioid=179197">create a login on our website.</a></li><li>You can either reserve a spot in one of the classes that you want to take by going to the &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; tab, or you can go to the &ldquo;Online Store&rdquo; tab to purchase your membership and then sign into the classes that you like. Note, you can also purchase contract memberships under the &ldquo;Contracts&rdquo; sub-tab in the Online Store. Also note, the intro class is free, but you still need to reserve your spot.</li><li>Once you have purchased your classes or membership, you&rsquo;ll need to reserve your spot for each class. This ensures quality control and helps regulate class size so that each client gets the individual attention that he or she needs. As we grow (Lord-willing), if a particular class time begins selling out frequently, we will open up the other room and get more coaching to allow for more class spaces. We will start with two rooms, but as a second building goes up next door to us, we will have expansion options.</li><ul><li>Download the MINDBODY Express mobile app for ease.</li><li>All our memberships are month to month with a 1 month notification to cancel.</li></ul><li>Come to class regularly. Change in health and fitness is about consistency, not about the first few months. Make fitness a way of life and a top priority and we can help you accomplish your goals.</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseEight" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> How often should I come? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><ul><li>Ideally you should come five times a week just so I can see you. I don&rsquo;t like to make money, I just love to sell memberships. ;)</li><ul><li>The reality is, we limit our class sizes for your benefit, and if you know me for any length of time, you&rsquo;ll know that I&rsquo;m not just interested in filling numbers. In fact, selling unlimited memberships is the least lucrative membership we offer but the one I recommend most. The truth is, once you get acclimated, five times a week will yield you the best results whether you&rsquo;re just looking to increase your overall well-being or looking to train for another sport or even become competitive in CrossFit.</li><li>So, there&rsquo;s the honest answer. I want to see you often, for your good. Next best would be four times a week and so on.</li></ul><li>I like Mark Rippetoe&rsquo;s sun tan analogy. If you only go out into the sun once or twice a week, you&rsquo;re more likely to get burnt, feel more pain, need more time to recover before you can go out into the sun, but if you go regularly, you&rsquo;re more likely to get the results that you want.</li><li>Becoming part of the community and forming relationships will be one of the best parts of your experience here at Infiltrate. The more you come, the better that happens.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseNine" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What days should I come? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><ul><li>The perfect schedule for you would be M, Tu, W, F, S with Thursdays and Sundays being rest days. The programming we use is designed with this schedule in mind, but of course this is not set in stone. If you miss a M/T/W class, you can come in Thursday to make it up. If you miss a F/S class, you can come in Sunday to make it up during Open Gym.</li><ul><li>I understand that not everyone can make this schedule or has signed up for unlimited membership so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</a></li><li>Basically, come in when you are able.</li></ul><li>If you must come in every day of the week, good for you! But please spend some time working on mobility, skills, and recovery. That&rsquo;s what Thursdays and Sundays should be for you.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseTen" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What type of programming do you use? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><ul><li>We use Outlaw programming from the <a href="http://www.theoutlawway.com">The Outlaw Way</a> because Rudy is really, really good at programming and he spends a lot of time doing it. He also has input from some of the best O-Lifting coaches, Power Lifting coaches, and Gymnastic coaches out there and their influence are all meshed well into his programming.</li><ul><li>Isn&rsquo;t that just for competitive athletes?</li><ul><li>No.</li><li>Here&rsquo;s a quote from Rudy: &ldquo;I have personally coached 27 CrossFit Games competitors, 7 CrossFit Games teams, the reigning 69kg National Weightlifting Champion, and &ndash; more importantly &ndash; we have a 65 year old lady named Maggie Cohen who could barely walk when she came in the door and can now deadlift 195, squat 135, and run a mile sub 10 minutes for the first time in her life &ndash; EVER. I know you&rsquo;ll say that everyone here is a former athlete, and is 20 years old, but it&rsquo;s not true. They are normal folks just like you. They simply have trusted me with their fitness, and they have not been disappointed.&rdquo;</li></ul><li>If you&rsquo;re a programming nerd, you can read more about <a href="http://theoutlawway.com/doctrine/outlaw-doctrine/">his programming</a> from Rudy himself.</li></ul><li>This from <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/what-crossfit.html">CrossFit.com</a>: The CrossFit program is designed for universal scalability making it the perfect application for any committed individual regardless of experience. We&rsquo;ve used our same routines for elderly individuals with heart disease and cage fighters one month out from televised bouts. We scale load and intensity; we don&rsquo;t change programs. The needs of the Olympic athletes and our grandparents differ by degree to kind. Our terrorist hunters, skiers, mountain bike riders and housewives have found their best fitness from the same regimen.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseEleven" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> Do you have showers? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body">We will in a few weeks!</div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseTwelve" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> Where do I park? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body">You can park in the parking garage or in the parking lot on the north side of 9th Street just west of Senate Ave.</div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-heading"><h4 class="panel-title"><a class="collapsed" href="#collapseThirteen" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion"> What should I bring to class? </a></h4></div><div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse"><div class="panel-body"><ul><li>A good attitude</li><ul><li>Outlook so often determines our outcome, and we are here not just to develop physical prowess but also mental toughness.</li><ul><li>Do not avoid classes with workouts you&rsquo;re not good at or dislike.
