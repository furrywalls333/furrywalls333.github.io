               <p><strong>What are your current CrossFit certifications (and any other fitness/health/nutrition accrediations)?</strong><br>Level 1 CF. Level 2 CF. CF Strongman. Donny Shankle weightlifting. Rx Jump Rope Jump Ropeology. Steve Maxwell Mobility. Beyond certifications, I have the experience of coaching thousands of classes and helping people of all levels accomplish their fitness goals. I started CrossFit in 2009.</p>

            <li>
               <p><strong>How did you get started with CrossFit?</strong><br>I was looking for workout ideas while living in the jungle of Costa Rica. I came across a YouTube video titled, "Navy diver does Fran (Not a Porno)." I watched it. I googled CrossFit, and I found the mainsite. After a fast, I began following mainsite WODs the day my first daughter was born. Having to make much of the equipment, I made due. Just a few months later I registered for the first ever online qualifier known at The CrossFit Open. Without a CrossFit gym in the country, I had to video all of my workouts. For one of the workouts, I had to take a four hour bus ride to a place that had a 20 lb wall ball. Let's just say I jumped right in. I placed 4th at the first ever Regional as an individual. It is also the first time I used a rower, kettlebell or bumper weights. I was in Costa Rica with my wife and two daughters (both born there) Noemi and Ruth as a missionary working with men addicted to crack cocaine. I was in the final steps in the process of opening a Reebok CrossFit gym in Costa Rica when the Lord had other plans. I moved back and worked at Wheeler Mission for a little over a year, and now pastors a church on the near West side and runs Finish Line's Corporate CrossFit affiliate. <br> CrossFit is much more than an exercise program. It's a means to learn skills that translate into becoming a better person not only physically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. CrossFit is relational. I missed out on this a lot during my first years CrossFitting. I also miss out on it a lot doing competitive training. Bearing one another's burdens in the gym allows us to connect on a deeper level that translates into a lifestyle of caring for others. Pushing through the pain helps us to press forward in the face of any adversity, and CrossFit is always a means for teaching us a lesson in humility.</p>

               <p><strong>Athletic background and achievements:</strong><br>I was a competitive athlete in high school wresting at the state tournament and making semi-state in soccer, but injuries and life-style choices hampered any further career in sports. In 2011 I qualified for the Regionals and placed 4th individually in Latin American. In 2012, I placed 25th in the Open in the Central East Region and placed 7th place at Regionals with team CFNT. In 2013, I placed 16th in the Central East Open and 4th on a team at Regionals. In 2014, I placed 27th in the Central East Open and 2nd at Regionals as a team finally qualifying for The CrossFit Games. My highest achievement was competing at the CrossFit Games in 2014 finishing 31st in the world.</p>

               <p><strong>Least favorite workout?</strong><br>Eva, not so much that I hate it now, but I choose this because of the horrible memory of it being my first CrossFit workout. I used a 70 lb dumbbell and it took me well over an hour to complete. The reality is that if I hate a workout, that will affect my mindset in that workout. I try not to do that.</p>

               <p><strong>How did you get started with CrossFit?<br></strong>I have always been active and an athlete.&nbsp; After finishing college basketball, I took a few months off.&nbsp; My routine after coming back resembled that of a body builder while still playing pick-up a few times a week.&nbsp; I did not enjoy going to the gym and saw the CrossFit Games on ESPN one night.&nbsp; I looked up a gym location near me, found one, and never looked back.</p>

               <p><strong>How did you get started with CrossFit?<br></strong>I got started with CrossFit when I stopped running at the collegiate level. After I stopped running I needed another way to push myself when it came to working out. I originally had my sights set on triathlons, but didn&rsquo;t enjoy the longer endurance based disciplines that I used to enjoy. Some friends told me about CrossFit and what it was and I was intrigued; however, at first I had no interest in it because I did not like lifting weights very much. After attempting baseline for the first time, and throwing up about halfway through the workout, I decided that I actually kind of liked getting my butt kicked and getting pushed to the puking point.</p>

               <p><strong>How did you get started with CrossFit?<br></strong>I got started into Crossfit when my brother-in-law introduced me to it. I was looking for something to mix up my physical activity and I had become bored with the monotonous routine of repeating the same workouts day after day. I went to the nearest gym and fell in love with Crossfit&rsquo;s community aspect. It made working out so much more than a physical fulfillment. I now had a place to not only exercise, but also spend time with like-minded people. At Crossfit Infiltrate, we are a family and that is what keeps me coming back.&nbsp;</p>

I worked up the courage to walk in to my first CrossFit gym (walking in is not as bad as what you think, we are nice people!) and I was hooked. I was able to work out and improve my entire body every class I took, gaining strength and new skills. CrossFit has provided the new challenges and progress I had been searching for mentally and physically, making me get out of my comfort zone. I've also been lucky enough to meet some of my best friends through the Indianapolis CrossFit community and consider them my family.&nbsp;</p>
